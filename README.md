# Interactive Form

An online form for attendees of a make-believe conference.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the third project of twelve. Starter html and css files were provided for me. I was tasked with programming the form's functionality, validating form data, changing the appearance of the form upon particular selections, and providing user-friendly error messages when form data entered by a user is found invalid.

## Installation:

Download the project files.

## Usage:

Open the index.html file in a browser.
